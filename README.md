# Data-Exploration-for-Ecoystem-Ecology

A starting repository for getting a look at data with a lot of environmental variables.

# Introduction

Welcome to my template for data exploration and analysis in ecosystem ecology! Since I first started my coding journey in 2020, I've learned a bit about how to successfully run statistics in ecosystem ecology, and some useful tricks to make the process quick and efficient in R. This template is the next step on that journey and will hopefully serve as a useful, evolving, collaborative tool for myself and others in our field for years to come! Please do reach out to me through Github or at [kaydee.barker@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:kaydee.barker@manchester.ac.uk) if you have questions or would like to contribute to making this template better! 

As a companion to this repo, here is a [Zotero Group Library dedicated to Stats in Ecology](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5995039/stats_in_ecology) (and R packages to run them).
